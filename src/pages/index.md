<!-- Your About Me section -->

Hi, I'm an **Backend Web Developer** based in Malang, Indonesia.

I am a 6th semester student in the Informatics Engineering study program at Malang State University. My nickname is an abbreviation of my long name, **_Bayu_**. I started choosing JavaScript as my initial focus. Learn Reactjs, Nextjs, NestJs, Typescript and tools such as Git, Postman, Figma which I always use in developing applications.

I'm interested coding, studying and experimenting for web and game.

<!-- Hi, I'm an independent web developer based in Kazan, Russia.

I mostly work with [frontend web development](https://domin.pro), designing user interfaces and improving user experience. My passion is tech so most of the projects I work on are open-source. Some projects are meant to automate my life, some are meant to express my obsession with art.

I'm interested in gaming, studying and experimenting with web design. -->
